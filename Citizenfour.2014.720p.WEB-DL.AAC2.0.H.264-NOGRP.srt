1
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,470
"Laura,

2
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,680
at this stage, I can offer nothing more than my word.

3
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,930
I'm a senior government employee in the intelligence community

4
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,210
I hope you understand that contacting you is extremely high risk

5
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,630
and you are willing to agree to the following precautions

6
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,280
before I share more.

7
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,260
This will not be a waste of your time.

8
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,560
The following sounds complex,

9
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,010
but should only take minutes to complete for someone technical.

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,200
I would like to confirm out of email
that the keys we exchanged were not intercepted

11
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,650
and replaced by your surveillants.

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,030
Please confirm that no one
has ever had a copy of your private key

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,180
and that it uses a strong passphrase.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,850
Assume your adversary is capable
of one trillion guesses per second.

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,610
If the device you store the private key
and enter your passphrase on

16
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,950
has been hacked,

17
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,310
it is trivial to decrypt our communications.

18
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,870
Understand that the above steps
are not bullet proof,

19
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,200
and are intended only to give us breathing room.

20
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,630
In the end if you publish the source material,

21
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,630
I will likely be immediately implicated.

22
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,360
This must not deter you from releasing
the information I will provide.

23
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,350
Thank you, and be careful.

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:00,300
Citizen Four"

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,710
Radio: ... surveillance means that there are facts

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,460
under the law to apply to

27
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,000
if we should take away the surveillance

28
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,410
there are no facts the government could manufacture

29
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,080
- Oh, that's right
and it's all about creating an independent record

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,800
- To me this goes to the question

31
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
of independently verifying

32
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,830
what the government is doing.

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,540
That's why I keep going
back to that question.

34
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:51,650
- So, that was David Suruda. 
After CBS News traffic and weather...

35
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,680
Hey, can you hear me?

36
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,480
I am here David, how are you?

37
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,060
Well, I would just point...

38
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,220
start by pointing to (what) Barack Obama 
himself said about those questions

39
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,130
when he was running for
the office that he now occupies.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,690
On December 2007 he said 
"The president does not have

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,910
the power under the Constitution to
unilaterally authorize a military attack

42
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,330
in a situation that does not involve stopping
an actual or imminent threat to the nation".

43
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,930
So by Obama's own words, the president doesn't
have the power that he is now exercising

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,630
under the Constitution.

45
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,070
And as far of why it matters,
in... on August 1st 2007

46
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,630
when he laid out his reasons
why he was running for office

47
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,470
and why he thought it was so important
to change the way we were doing things

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,520
he said

49
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:47,980
"No more ignoring the law
when it's inconvenient,

50
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,600
that is not who we are.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,570
We will again set an example for the world
that the law is not subject 

52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,060
to the whims of stubborn rulers."

53
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,045
- So to allow presidents to simply
start wars on their own without any...

54
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,740
For now, know that every border you cross, every purchase you make,

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,960
every call you dial, every cell phone tower you pass,

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,370
friend you keep, article you write,

57
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,030
site you visit, subject line you type,

58
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,900
and packet you route,

59
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,530
is in the hands of a system 
whose reach is unlimited

60
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,760
but whose safeguards are not.

61
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,950
Your victimisation by the NSA system means 
that you are well aware

62
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,070
of the threat 
that unrestricted secret police pose

63
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,100
for democracies.

64
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,580
This is a story few, but you, can tell.

65
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,400
Thank you for inviting me here,

66
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,890
to give me the opportunity to express my story.

67
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,660
But let me give you some of my background.

68
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,240
I spent about 4 years in the military and then I went to NSA directly, so...

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,360
so I ended up with about 37 years of service combined.

70
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,110
Most of it was a lot of fun!
I tell you, it was really a lot of fun,

71
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,410
breaking these puzzles.

72
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,250
You know, solving problems
and things like that.

73
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,320
So, and that's really what I did.

74
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,740
Fundamentally started working with data,
looking at data and datasystems

75
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,990
and how you do that.

76
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,100
I was developing this concept of analysis
where you could lay it out in such a way

77
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,350
that it could be coded and executed electronically.
Meaning you could automate analysis.

78
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,200
And it has to do with metadata
and using metadata relationships.

79
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,040
So that was the whole,
that was my whole theme there at NSA

80
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,450
that was eventually what I ended up to,
I was the only one there doing that, by the way.

81
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,970
So any rate, you know, 9/11 happened.

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,130
And it must have been right after.

83
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,680
A few days, no more than a week after 9/11

84
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,610
that they decided to begin actively spying on everyone in this country.

85
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:16,230
And they wanted that back part of our program to run all the spying.

86
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,920
So that's that's exactly what they did.

87
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,430
And then they started taking the telecom data,

88
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,230
and expanded after that.

89
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,600
So, I mean, the one I knew was AT&T,

90
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,880
and that one provided
320 million records every day.

91
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,820
That program was reauthorized every 45 days by the,

92
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,930
what I call the "Yes Committee"

93
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,830
which way Hayden, and Tenet, and the DOJ,

94
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,990
that program was called STELLARWIND.

95
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,990
So first I went to the
House Intelligence Committee,

96
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,060
and the staff member I personally knew there

97
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,130
and she then went to the Chairman
of that Committee, Nancy Pelosi,

98
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,460
who was the Minority Rep.

99
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,220
They were all briefed in to
the program at the time, by the way,

100
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,160
and all the other programs that were going on,

101
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,000
including all those CIA programs.

102
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,770
I wasn't alone in this,
there were four others out of NSA,

103
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,220
we were all trying to work interally
in the government over these years

104
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,150
trying to get them to come around,
to being constitutionally acceptable,

105
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,710
and take it in to the courts
and have the courts' oversight of it too.

106
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,560
So we naïvely kept thinking
that that could, that could happen,

107
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,140
and it never did.

108
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:28,910
But any rate after that
and all the stuff we were doing

109
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,990
they decided to raid us
to keep us quiet,

110
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,490
threaten us, you know.

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,490
So we were raided simultaneously,
four of us.

112
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,600
In my case they came in
with guns drawn,

113
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,720
I don't know why they did that,
but they did. So....

114
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,300
"Laura,

115
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,920
I will answer what I remember

116
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,980
of your questions as best I can.

117
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,570
Forgive the lack of structure, I am not a writer,

118
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,820
and I have to draft this in a great hurry.

119
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,780
What you know as STELLARWIND has grown,

120
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,080
SSO,

121
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,090
the expanded Special Source Operations that took over STELLARWIND's share

122
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,330
of the pie

123
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,060
has spread all over the world

124
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,140
to practically include

125
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,160
comprehensive coverage of the United States.

126
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,100
Disturbingly, the amount of US communication

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,300
ingested by NSA is still increasing.

128
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,740
Publicly,

129
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,500
we complain that things are going dark,

130
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,760
but in fact our accesses are improving.

131
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,870
The truth is that the NSA has never

132
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,680
in its history

133
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,060
collected more than it does now.

134
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:51,230
I know the location of most 
domestic interception points,

135
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,730
and that the largest 
telecommunication companies in the US

136
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,880
are betraying the trust of their customers,

137
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,480
which I can prove.

138
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,030
We are building the greatest weapon 
for oppression in the history of Man.

139
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,200
Yet its directors 
exempt themselves from accountability.

140
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,040
NSA director Keith Alexander 
lied to Congress,

141
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,730
which I can prove.

142
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,360
Billions of US communications 
are being intercepted.

143
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,220
In gathering evidence of wrongdoing

144
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,010
I focused on the wronging 
of the American people,

145
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,590
but believe me when I say that 
the surveillance we live under

146
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,810
is the highest privilege 
compared to how we treat

147
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,460
the rest of the world,

148
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,910
this I can also prove.

149
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,600
On cyberoperations 
the government's public position

150
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,550
is that we still lack a policy framework.

151
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,860
This too is a lie.

152
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,680
There is a detailed policy framework,

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,370
a kind of martial law for Cyber Operations

154
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,240
created by the White House.

155
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,600
It's called "Presidential Policy Directive 20"

156
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,470
and was finalized at the end of last year.

157
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,870
This I can also prove.

158
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,750
I appreciate your concern for my safety,

159
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,120
but I already know how this will end for me,

160
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,780
and I accept the risk.

161
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,050
If I have luck, and you are careful,

162
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,770
you will have everything you need.

163
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,160
I ask only that you ensure

164
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,230
this information makes it home 
to the American public.

165
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,100
Does the NSA routinely intercept 
American citizen's emails?

166
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,585
No.

167
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,330
Does the NSA intercept Americans' 
cell phone conversations.

168
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,490
No.

169
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,940
Google searches?

170
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:28,940
No.

171
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,350
Text messages?

172
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,200
No.

173
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,290
Amazon.com orders?

174
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:34,530
Nope

175
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,580
Bank records?

176
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,380
No.

177
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,750
What judicial consent is required for NSA

178
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,630
to intercept communications

179
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,080
and information 
involving American citizens?

180
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,420
Within the United States 
that would be the FBI lead.

181
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,550
If it was a foreign actor in the United states

182
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,070
the FBI would still have the lead 
and could work that with NSA

183
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,860
or other intelligence 
agencies as authorized.

184
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,390
But to conduct that kind

185
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,270
of collection within the United states

186
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,450
it would have to go through a court order.

187
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,020
And the court would have to authorize it.

188
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,250
We are not authorized to do it,

189
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,040
nor do we do it.

190
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,980
All rise.

191
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,530
The United States Court of Appeals

192
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,700
for the Ninth Circuit is now in session.

193
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,100
Please be seated.

194
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,000
Good morning and welcome 
to the Ninth Circuit.

195
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,810
The first case for argument is 
Jewell vs. National Security Agency.

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,530
You may proceed.

197
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:51,860
May it please the Court, 
Kevin Bankston for Carolyn Jewell

198
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,950
and her fellow plaintiff appellants 
in Jewell vs. NSA.

199
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,540
- Your Honors,

200
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:00,430
plaintiffs have specifically 
alleged that their own communications

201
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,670
and communications records have been 
acquired by the government.

202
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,670
But the District Court found that 
we failed to allege facts

203
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,010
that differentiated the injury 
of our plaintiffs sufferred

204
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,590
from the injury suffered 
by every other AT&T user

205
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,550
whose communications and records 
have been acquired by the government.

206
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,080
Basically concluding that so long as 
every one is being surveilled,

207
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,350
no one has standing to sue.

208
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,500
However to deny standing to persons 
who are injured simply because

209
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,370
many others are also injured 
would mean that the most injurious

210
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,310
and widespread government actions 
could be questioned by nobody.

211
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,140
- Do they have anything concrete 
that in fact a specific communication

212
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:41,430
of your client was intercepted?

213
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,760
- We have evidence that all 
the communications passing

214
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,420
between AT&T's network and other networks 
in their Northern California facility

215
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,880
have been intercepted, 
so that would necessarily include

216
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,700
the Internet communications of 
our Northern California plaintiffs.

217
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,370
- Okay, thank you.

218
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,530
- Thank you, your honor

219
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:06,960
- May it please the Court,

220
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,990
I'm Thomas Byron from 
the Department of Justice

221
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,970
here on behalf of 
the Government defendants.

222
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,810
We think this litigation 
need not be resolved in Federal Court.

223
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,090
In light of the oversight 
of the political branches

224
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,150
both Legislative and Executive,

225
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,480
which provides a better opportunity 
for oversight and resolution

226
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,070
of the concerns raised 
concerning nationwide policies

227
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:35,040
of alleged surveillance 
in these complaints.

228
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,620
- Even if it's revealed 
that one or more of the plaintiffs

229
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,280
had email or telephone conversations 
intercepted that had nothing to do

230
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,980
with the national security?

231
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
- Your honor, I don't know 
that anyone necessarily

232
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,530
would have standing to raise
the particular claims that issue

233
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,330
in these 2 cases.

234
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:58,260
We think instead that the kinds of claims
that issue here against these defendants

235
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,050
are those that are 
better suited to resolution

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,940
before the representative branches 
of our government...

237
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:10,340
- What role... would the Judiciary have 
if your.. approach is adopted...

238
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,790
- Judge Peterson, I think the...

239
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,260
- I mean, we just get out of the way, is that it?

240
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,690
- Well, Judge Peterson, what I think 
is that there is a narrow category,

241
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,180
subset of cases in which 
it may be appropriate

242
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,940
to step aside
for that narrow category of cases.

243
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,570
- But mmm... the Judiciary plays a role...

244
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,840
- To be sure, Judge Peterson....

245
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,220
- ...in our system.

246
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,320
- Yes Your Honor and we don't mean to diminish that.

247
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,010
-  You're asking us to abdicate that role

248
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,730
- No, Your Honor,

249
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,610
but it is a question of this court's discretion
whether to reach that issue.

250
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,730
We do think that there is simply
no way for the litigation to proceed

251
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,250
without risk of divulging 
those very questions of privileged information

252
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,910
that would cause, 
as Director of National Intelligence

253
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,320
has explained,

254
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,450
exceptionally great damage to 
National Security's disclose.

255
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,270
Thanks for having me.

256
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,370
Hum, if anybody has any questions,
like I said just..

257
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,190
Basically just raise your hand 
and I'll try to call on you

258
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,700
as soon as I possibly can.

259
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,290
So, who here actually feels like 
they are under surveillance,

260
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,220
pretty regularly?

261
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,810
Everyone inside of Occupy.

262
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,620
How many people here have been arrested

263
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,710
and at their Court date had
their phone taken into the back room?

264
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,290
How many people here
had their retina scanned?

265
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,590
Wow.

266
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,040
So you guys are actually, in a sense, 
the canaries in the coal mine,

267
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:36,990
right,

268
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,960
because the incentives 
are all lined up against you.

269
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,020
Anybody see how the subway link 
your metro card to your debit card,

270
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,860
right? And, like, auto refill.

271
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,470
This is a concept which is key 
to everything we'll talk about today.

272
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,960
And it's called linkability.

273
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,000
Take one piece of data 
and link it to another piece of data.

274
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,420
So for example,

275
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,790
if you have your metro card 
and you have your debit card,

276
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,890
you have those things 
and you can draw a line between them right?

277
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,860
So that's, like, not a scary thing.

278
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,380
Except your bank card is tied 
to everything else that you do during the day.

279
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:07,560
So now they know where you're going, 
when you make purchases.

280
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,560
So when they decide to target you, 
they can actually recreate your exact steps.

281
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,910
With a metro card and with a credit card alone.

282
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,950
Like literally where you go and what you buy

283
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:18,940
and potentially by linking that data with other people

284
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,150
on similar travel plans,

285
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,460
they can figure out who you 
talk to and who you met with.

286
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,740
When you then take cellphone data, 
which logs your location

287
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,160
and you link up purchasing data, 
metro card data and your debit card.

288
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,660
You start to get what you could call metadata,

289
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,690
an aggregate over a person's life.

290
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,700
And metadata, an aggregate, is content.

291
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:41,600
It tells a story about you,

292
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,770
which is made up of facts, 
but is not necessarily true.

293
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,790
So for example, just because 
you were on the corner,

294
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,500
and all these data points point to it, 
it doesn't mean you committed the crime.

295
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,410
So it's important to note

296
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,650
that if someone has a perception 
of you having done a thing,

297
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,230
it will  now follow you 
for the rest of your life.

298
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:00,140
So just keep in mind that 
what happens to you guys for example

299
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,120
with fingerprints, and retinal scans, and photographs.

300
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,410
That is what is going to happen 
to people in the future

301
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,550
when they resist policy changes 
and when they try to protest

302
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,220
in a totally constitutionally protected way.

303
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,055
This is for you, Director Clapper, again on the surveillance front.

304
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,020
And I hope we can do this in just a yes or no answer,

305
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,320
because I know Senator Feinstein wants to move on.

306
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:25,790
- So, does the NSA collect any type of data at all,

307
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,000
on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans ?

308
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,310
- No sir.

309
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,010
- It does not?

310
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,490
- Not wittingly.

311
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,820
There are cases where they could inadvertently,

312
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:43,900
perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.

313
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,830
Email from April 2013

314
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,610
The encrypted archive

315
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:13,380
should be available to you within seven days.

316
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,400
The key will follow when everything else is done.

317
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,490
The material provided,

318
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,590
and investigative effort required 
will be too much for any one person.

319
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,140
I recommend at a very minimum 
you involve Glen Greenwald.

320
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,290
I believe you know him.

321
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,520
The plaintext of the payload

322
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,550
will include my true name details 
for the record.

323
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,600
Though it will be your decision

324
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,830
as to whether or how 
to declare my involvement.

325
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,280
My personal desire is that you 
paint the target directly on my back.

326
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:51,820
No one, not even my most trusted confidant, 
is aware of my intentions

327
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,750
and it would not be fair for them 
to fall under suspicion for my actions.

328
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,920
You may be the only one 
who can prevent that,

329
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,730
and that is by immediately 
nailing me to the cross

330
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,950
rather than trying 
to protect me as a source.

331
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,970
On timing, regarding 
meeting up in Hong Kong,

332
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,150
the first rendezvous attempt 
will be at 10 A.M. local time

333
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
on Monday.

334
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,840
We will meet in the hallway outside of the restaurant

335
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,590
in the Mira Hotel.

336
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,770
I will be working on a Rubik's cube

337
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,250
so that you can identify me.

338
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,410
Approach me and ask if I know the hours of the restaurant.

339
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,990
I'll respond by stating that I'm not sure

340
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,810
and suggest you try the lounge instead.

341
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,000
I'll offer to show you where it is, and at that point we're good.

342
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,010
You simply need to follow naturally.

343
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,250
As far as positioning I mean

344
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,560
if you want us to sit in any particular way or whatever.

345
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,590
You know, I'm gonna go there just like we get better light.

346
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,540
There is, you know, so many different

347
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,930
enormous stories

348
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,370
just that are kind of standalone stories

349
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:46,420
that, even like you know certain things on my individual document

350
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,620
that can just be their own story

351
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,930
and I just want to start turning those stories out.

352
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,010
I basically woke up this morning and I already started writing stories

353
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,530
hum so I'm hoping to, you know,

354
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,080
start publishing within like a day or two days.

355
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,140
- OK

356
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,680
it's as long as you're good with that

357
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:02,440
- Yeah

358
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,320
and so as far as I...

359
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,700
the stuff we have to talk about,

360
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,010
I mean I'm kind of like

361
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,580
dichotomizing it between,

362
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,900
you know, stuff that I'd like 
to talk you about,

363
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,760
in terms of like the documents 
and the content.

364
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,500
Laura has a bunch of questions 
about that as well.

365
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,280
So while we're working through 
the documents getting your take-on,

366
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,110
a lot of the stuff that, you know,

367
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:24,760
help me understand it better, 
but then also the sort of You story, right...

368
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,650
<i>like the who you are</>?

369
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,320
- Yeah

370
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,460
what you've done, why you've 
done what you've done

371
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:29,810
- Yeah

372
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,520
and I'd love to do that first

373
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:31,920
- OK

374
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,020
in part because, you are 
the only one who can do that

375
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,700
- Yeah

376
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,240
so I'd like to just get it done 
so let it's done,

377
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,150
and also because, you know, 
it might be that you wanna do that early

378
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:42,980
- Yeah

379
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,990
because, it might be necessary, 
we might choose to have that done early.

380
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:50,070
What are you... tell me your thoughts, 
just where you are with that?

381
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,430
- So primary one on that, 
I think I've expressed it

382
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,780
a couple times online,

383
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:58,730
is I feel the modern media 
has a big focus on personalities.

384
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,760
- Totally

385
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,470
- And I'm a little concerned (that)
the more we focus on that

386
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,560
the more they're going 
to use that as a distraction.

387
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,860
I don't necessarily want that to happen, 
which is why I've consistently said, you know,

388
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:16,090
I'm not the story here, 
hum haha, nervous uh?

389
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,970
- No it's a very very cheap pen, I just, the slider is broke, 
go ahead.

390
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:27,770
- Hum, but hum, yeah, anything I can do 
to help you guys get this out,

391
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,110
I will do,

392
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,940
I don't have any experience 
with media, with how this works

393
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,110
so I'm kind of learning as I go.

394
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,090
Right, so, I just want to get a sense of 
why did you decide to do what you've done.

395
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,660
So for me it all comes down to 
State Power against the people's ability

396
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,480
to meaningfully oppose that power.

397
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:54,290
And I'm sitting there everyday,

398
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:00,190
getting payed to design methods 
to amplify that State Power.

399
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,510
And I'm realizing that if, you know, 
the policy switches,

400
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,500
that there are the only things that restrains 
these states, were changed,

401
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,380
there, you couldn't meaningfully 
oppose these.

402
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:17,720
I mean, you have to be the most 
incredibly sophisticated ta* col* actor in existence.

403
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:22,650
I'm not sure there's anybody, 
no matter how gifted you are,

404
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,200
who could oppose all of the 
offices and all the bright people

405
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,000
even all the mediocre people out there 
with all of their tools and all of their capabilities.

406
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,360
And as I saw the promise 
of the Obama administration

407
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,770
be betrayed and walk away from it. 
In fact, actually advance

408
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,740
the things that had been promised 
to be sort of curtailed and rained in

409
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,580
and dialed back.

410
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,120
It actually gets worse,
particularly drone strikes.

411
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,600
Which I also learned in NSA,

412
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,810
we could watch drone videos 
from our desktops,

413
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:01,620
as I saw that, that really hardened me to action.

414
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:02,850
- In real time?

415
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,230
- In real time, yeah,

416
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,060
it'll stream a lower quality 
of the video to your desktop,

417
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,540
typically you'd be watching surveillance drones
as opposed to actually letting you know,

418
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,570
murder drones really going out there 
and bomb somebody.

419
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:19,030
But you'll have a drone 
that's just following somebody's house

420
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,580
for hours and hours.

421
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,590
And you won't know who it is because, you know,

422
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,070
you don't have the context for that 
but it's just a page

423
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,320
where it's lists 
and lists of drone feeds

424
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,270
and all these different countries 
with all these different code names

425
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,680
and you can just click 
on which one you want to see.

426
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,370
- Right, so if your self interest 
is to live in a world in which

427
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,640
there's maximum privacy,

428
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,370
doing something that could 
put you into prison,

429
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,470
in which your privacy is completely destroyed 
is sort of the antithesis of that,

430
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:53,720
how did you reach the point where 
that was a worthwhile calculation for you?

431
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,670
- I remember what the Internet was like 
before it was being watched.

432
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:00,710
And there has never been anything 
in the history of man like it.

433
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,420
I mean you could have children 
from one part of the world

434
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,790
having an equal discussion,

435
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,370
where you know they were sort of granted

436
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,370
the same respect 
for their ideas and conversation,

437
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,750
with experts in the field 
from another part of the world

438
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,320
on any topic, anywhere, 
anytime, all the time.

439
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,140
And it was free and unrestrained.

440
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:29,410
And we've seen the chilling of that, 
the cooling of that and the changing

441
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,850
of that model towards something 
which people self police their own views.

442
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:36,920
And they literally make 
their own jokes on ending up on the list

443
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,390
if they donate to a political cause 
or if they say something in a discussion.

444
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,580
And it has become an expectation that we're being watched.

445
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:50,120
Many people I've talked to have mentioned 
that they're careful about what they type

446
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,840
into search engines.

447
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,740
Because they know that it's being recorded.

448
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:57,910
And that limits the boundaries 
of their intellectual exploration.

449
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,520
And I'm more willing to risk

450
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,160
imprisonment

451
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,390
or any other negative outcome personally

452
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,120
than I am willing to risk

453
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,980
the curtailment of my intellectual freedom

454
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,300
and that of those around me,

455
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:26,270
whom I care for equally as I do for myself.

456
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,470
And again that's not to say that I'm self sacrificing

457
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,710
because it gives me, I feel good,

458
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,660
in my human experience

459
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,900
to know that I can contribute to the good of others.

460
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,530
- Could you elaborate on that?

461
00:27:57,290 --> 00:28:01,740
- So, I don't know how much the programs 
and the actual technical capacities

462
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,350
everybody's talked to you about 
but there is an infrastructure in place

463
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,440
in the United States 
and world wide that NSA has built

464
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,120
in cooperation with 
other governments as well,

465
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,860
that intercepts

466
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,220
basically every

467
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,230
digital communication,

468
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,550
every radio communication,

469
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,800
every analog communication

470
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:31,420
that it has sensors in place to detect.

471
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,170
And with these capabilities,

472
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,170
basically the vast majority

473
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,930
of human

474
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,860
and computer to computer communications,

475
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,340
device-based communication,

476
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,920
which that sort of then forms 
the relationships between humans,

477
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,150
are automatically ingested 
without targeting.

478
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:56,020
And that allows individuals 
to retroactively

479
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:00,400
search your communications 
based on self certifications.

480
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,330
So for example, if I wanted 
to see the content

481
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,580
of your email or,

482
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,630
you know, your wife's phone calls

483
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,510
or anything like that.

484
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,810
All I have to do is use 
what's called a selector.

485
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,230
Any kind of thing

486
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,520
in the communication's chain

487
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,010
that might uniquely or almost uniquely

488
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:24,980
identify you as an individual.

489
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,080
And I'm talking about 
things like email addresses,

490
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,840
IP addresses, phone numbers,

491
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,090
credit cards,

492
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,920
even passwords

493
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,710
that are unique to you, 
that aren't used by anyone else.

494
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,040
I can input those into the system

495
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,530
and it will not only go 
back through the database

496
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:45,550
and go 
"have I seen this anywhere in the past?",

497
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,270
it will basically put an 
additional level of scrutiny on it

498
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,580
moving into the future that says

499
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,530
"if this is detected now 
or at anytime in the future,

500
00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:00,300
I want this to go to me immediately" 
and alert me in real time

501
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,080
that you're communicating 
with someone,

502
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,000
things like that.

503
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:09,690
- So I don't know who you are 
or anything about you.

504
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,760
- Ok. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton, 
defense contractor.

505
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,360
I am sort of on loan to NSA, 
I don't talk to Booz Allen boss,

506
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,840
I don't get tasking from Booz Allen, 
it's all from NSA.

507
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,770
- So, I don't know your name.

508
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,500
- Oh, sorry, my name is Edward Snowden,

509
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,230
I go by Ed.

510
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,720
Edward Joseph Snowden is the full name.

511
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,080
(spelling) S. N. O. W. D. E. N..

512
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,570
- And where are you from ?

513
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:44,310
- I'm originally...
I was born in North Carolina,

514
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:46,500
small town, Elizabeth City.

515
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,660
There is a Coast Guard station there,

516
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm from a military family.

517
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:54,130
But I spent most of my time 
growing up around Fort Meade in Maryland.

518
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,990
- And your family, 
what's the consequences for them?

519
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,580
- This is actually 
what has made this hardest.

520
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,460
My family doesn't know 
what's happening, they're unaware.

521
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:17,730
I don't think I'll be able 
to keep the family ties

522
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,920
that I've had for all my life

523
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,580
because of the risk of 
associating them with this.

524
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,780
And I'll leave what to publish 
and what not to publish to you guys,

525
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:38,180
I trust you'll be responsible on this. 
But basically, the closer I stay to my family,

526
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,530
the more likely they are 
to be leaned on.

527
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,950
- So you don't want me to report this?

528
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:45,040
- We dont have ... I mean, 
we definitely want to do

529
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,830
whatever we can not to 
include them or bring them into the mix

530
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,370
- Oh I'm sorry that's fine, I won't...

531
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,070
- I'm sorry I'm going to interrupt you.

532
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,930
Can we just stop for a second, 
do the document and then go back to that?

533
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,630
- What do I need? Do I need 
an email address that we're using or...

534
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:06,170
- Well you can send... Once you've encrypted it, 
you can send it from whatever you think is appropriate.

535
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,870
The main thing is 
you've got to encapsulate all of this

536
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,300
in a way that it can't be 
decrypted and read

537
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,260
once it's in transit across the 
network or on either of the end points.

538
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,000
- Ok I mean just  so you know 
these documents are basically all going

539
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,490
to be uploaded within like 48 hours.

540
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,170
- This is simply..

541
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,600
You want to get in the process 
of doing this for everything because

542
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,870
it seems hard but it's not hard, 
this is super easy.

543
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:32,530
- Ok so just walk me through it.

544
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:37,050
- Ok. Show me the actual folder structure 
where these files are first.

545
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,620
- How many documents 
did you say there were?

546
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,250
- Seven

547
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,130
- Ok well, while you're working...

548
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:47,060
- Ok go ahead

549
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,520
- How many documents are we talking about?

550
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,660
Because in The Guardian,

551
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,670
that Wikileaks, technical people

552
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,440
set up a system

553
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,030
so that they were available 
for anybody to see

554
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,990
and I just wonder if it's 
possible to do the same thing.

555
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,910
- That would be the ideal end game.

556
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,930
But because some of these documents 
are legitimately classified

557
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:14,900
in ways that could cause harm 
to people and methods.

558
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:19,100
I'm comfortable in my 
technical ability to protect them.

559
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,110
I mean you could literally 
shoot me or torture me

560
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:24,790
and I could not disclose 
the password, if I wanted to.

561
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,230
I have the sophistication to do that.

562
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,490
There are some journalists
that I think could do that,

563
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,840
but there are a number 
of them that couldn't.

564
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,020
But the question becomes,

565
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,270
can an organization

566
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,400
actually control that information

567
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,970
in that manner

568
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,050
without risking basically 
an uncontrolled disclosure?

569
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,300
But I do agree with that, honestly

570
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,600
I don't want to be 
the person making the decisions

571
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,630
on what should be public 
and what shouldn't.

572
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,090
Which is why rather than 
publishing these on my own,

573
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,180
or putting them out openly, 
I'm running them through journalists.

574
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:04,920
So that my bias, and my things,

575
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,700
because clearly 
I have some strongly held views,

576
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,960
are removed from that equation

577
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,840
and the public interest is being 
represented in the most responsible manner.

578
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:14,600
- Yeah.

579
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:22,250
- Actually given your sort of... 
Geographic familiarity

580
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,910
with the U.K and whatnot.

581
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:32,360
I'd like to point out that 
GCHQ has probably the most invasive...

582
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,480
- I know 
- network intercept program anywhere in the world.

583
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:41,950
It's called TEMPORA, 
(spelling) T. E. M. P. O. R. A.

584
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,000
and it's the world's first "full take", 
they call it, and that means 

585
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,600
content in addition to metadata

586
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,230
on everything.

587
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,430
- So this is what I'd like to do 
just in term of scheduling

588
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:58,190
if it's good with everybody else. 
Are you feeling you're done?

589
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,590
- Yeah yeah I'm done.

590
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,770
- So, I'm anxious to go back,

591
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,360
get those articles done

592
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,510
and then there is a 
bunch of documents

593
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,480
that aren't about those first two or three stories 
that I'd like to spend time with you...

594
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,400
- Sure yeah

595
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,510
- ...kinda going over.

596
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,110
- I'm not going anywhere.

597
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,660
- You're available? 
You want to check your book first?

598
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,450
- Let me check my schedule.

599
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,540
- Is that good for you Laura? 
You want to...

600
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,770
- It's great.
- OK

601
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,720
- Hello

602
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,250
- Yes

603
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:47,070
- My meal was great thank you very much

604
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:50,440
- No I still have some left and I think 
I'm gonna be eating it later

605
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,430
so you can just leave me alone for now.

606
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,940
- Ok great thank you so much, have a good one bye.

607
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,440
Let's fix that real quick.

608
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,380
So another fun thing I was telling 
Laura about this:

609
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,410
all these new VOIP phones

610
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,900
they have little computers in them

611
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,390
and you can hot mike these 
over the network,

612
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,700
all the time even when 
the receiver's down so...

613
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,340
as long as it's plugged in

614
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:18,520
it can be listening on.

615
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:21,510
And I haven't even considered 
that earlier. But yeah...

616
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,380
- OK.

617
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,270
- There are so many ways... This could be...

618
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:26,660
Everything that's in here 
is pretty much gonna be

619
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,360
on the public record at some point.

620
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,830
We should operate on that.

621
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,720
- Yeah. Yeah, I think... 
I think we are...

622
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,090
- So, do you have your 
air gapped machine with you?

623
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,230
- I do, I do.

624
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,530
- Let me pop that out.

625
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,550
- Do you have an 
understanding or commitment on

626
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,150
when you guys are gonna 
to press for the first stories?

627
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,050
- It's very seven or eight 
in the morning in London.

628
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,700
- Uh uh, OK.

629
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,940
Oh, let's see here.

630
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,330
Ok, hey look there's another one.

631
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:09,760
Pro tip, let's not leave the same SD cards
in our laptops forever in the future.

632
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:18,020
- Did you know this was still 
kicking around in your laptop?

633
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,140
- Yeah, I mean that was the... mmh...

634
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,270
- OK, just to make it sure.

635
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,770
- OK, yeah. This is it?

636
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:23,180
- Yeah.

637
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:23,910
- OK.

638
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,760
- Right there.

639
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,810
- Thanks. You will have a new one 
who will look exactly identical

640
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,340
but it's a different archive. 
So you might want to take 

641
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:35,900
Could you pass me my 
magic mantle of power?

642
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,560
- Uh uh...

643
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,030
Is that about possibility of overhead?

644
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,450
- Visual. yes, 
Visual collection.

645
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,200
I don't think at this point 
there is anything in this regards

646
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,200
that would shock us.

647
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,330
We become pretty... 
Ewen you once said before,

648
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,830
he's like, he's like: 
I'm never leaving my room,

649
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:06,990
I'm never leaving anything 
in my room again.

650
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,040
And the single machine...
I was like

651
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:12,780
you've been infected by the paranoia bug, 
happens to all of us.

652
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,760
He was like...
I would never leave a single of these device,

653
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,940
and I would never leave my and again alone.

654
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,790
- My bag's getting heavier and heavier

655
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,790
- Exactly

656
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,340
Alright, I'm gonna need you to enter

657
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:31,910
your root password 'cause 
I don't know what it is.

658
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,160
If you wanna use this 
you're more than welcome, so uh ..

659
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,160
- OK, looks like your root 
password's not 4 caracters long anyway.

660
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,470
- it's usually a lot longer 
but that's just like a one time only thing, right?

661
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,370
- So, it is uh...

662
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:46,800
- It had been a lot longer but ever since 
I knew is that it was a one time only session,

663
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,290
I've been making it shorter. Is that not good?

664
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,200
- It's actually not. I was expressing this 
with Laura either.

665
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,840
The issue is because of the fact 
it's got a hardware MAC address

666
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,870
and things like that,

667
00:38:57,170 --> 00:39:01,630
and if people are able to identify 
your machine and they're able to...

668
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,810
- This is the fact you're about 
to break the most upsetting story?

669
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,120
- Yeah, that's true.

670
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,740
- So they might kinda prioritize

671
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,100
- It's ten letters I type very quickly. 
Actually it's ten letters but...

672
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,170
- So ten letters would be good 
if they had to bruteforce the entire key space.

673
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,570
That would still probably only take 
a couple of days for NSA. Uh...

674
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:26,970
That's a fire alarm, OK...

675
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:32,310
- hopefully this just sounds like a 3 seconds test 
or is this...

676
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,460
Do you wanna to call the desk and ask? It's fine.

677
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,280
- Yeah, I don't think it's an issue, 
but it's interesting that I just.

678
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:41,570
- did that happen before?

679
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:45,900
- Maybe they got mad cause they couldn't listen 
into us through the phone anymore.

680
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,380
- Has the fire alarm gone off before?

681
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:59,540
- No that's the first time that has happened. 
Let me... so just in case they have like an alert 

682
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,950
- We probably...

683
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,770
- We might have to evacuate.

684
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:07,400
- Should we ignore that, I don't know?

685
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:09,150
- It's not continuous.

686
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,660
- It's not continuous. 
No, I'm just saying if it continues...

687
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,610
- And then we come and 
meet the guys down in the lobby.

688
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:20,890
- Yeah, alright.

689
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,360
- Yeah.

690
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:29,040
- Yeah let's, let's leave for now 
when we'll have finished this up.

691
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,820
Not that they're gonna answer 'cause 
they probably have seven thousands calls.

692
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,190
- Yeah.

693
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,690
- Hi, we hear a loud buzzing on the tenth flour.

694
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,160
Can you tell us what that is?

695
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,400
Ah, OK.

696
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,000
OK, great.

697
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,400
Thank you, bye.

698
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,040
Fire alarm testing, maintenance.

699
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:03,030
- Yes. that's good, 
that's what I wanted to hear.

700
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:11,140
- Nice of them to... 
Nice of them to let us know 

701
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,930
Uhm, I just wanna give you 
kind of a quick tour, uh..

702
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,370
when Laura was looking at this 
she was kind of salivating...

703
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:19,650
and couldn't stop like 
actually reading these documents

704
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,760
- Right, right. 
So we'll try and restrain ourselves

705
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,410
although I don't promise 
that it will succeed.

706
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:26,010
- I just wanna kinda explain 
a brief overview

707
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:28,560
of what these are 
and how they're organized.

708
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,900
On the beginning of 
document of interest,

709
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:33,590
the primary purposes of the second archive 
is to bring the focus over to

710
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,900
SSO as opposed to PRISM.

711
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,470
This is in general. 
SSO are the Special Source Operations.

712
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,250
This is the world wide 
passive collection on networks

713
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:49,110
they're both domestic to the US 
and international.

714
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,650
There's a lot of 
different ways they do it

715
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,710
but, uh corporate partnerships 
are one of the primary things,

716
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:57,060
they do domestically 
they also do this for multinationals

717
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,520
that might be headquarted 
in the US so they can kinda coerce

718
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,740
or just pay into giving them access.

719
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,220
And they also do bilaterally 
with the assistance of certain governments.

720
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,430
And that's based on the premise that they go

721
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:10,990
"All right, we'll help you set the system up 
if you give us all the data from it".

722
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:16,590
Hum, there's... there's a lot more here

723
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,010
than any one person 
or probably one team could do.

724
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,160
- Right

725
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,290
Hum, XKEYSCORE Deep Dive.

726
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,000
XKEYSCORE in general, and there's 
a huge folder of documentation

727
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,000
on XKEYSCORE and how it works,

728
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:30,990
is the front-end system 
that analysts use

729
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,330
for querying that sort of ocean of raw singing
that I was telling you about.

730
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:37,670
All that stuff where you can sort of 
do the retroactive searches,

731
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,820
live searches, get flagging, what not.

732
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,940
XKEYSCORE is the front-end for that.

733
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:48,480
I'm just gonna show you one slide here, 
'cause Laura thought it was valuable

734
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,090
on this talk on kinda 
how these capabilities ramp up

735
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,760
in sophistication over time.

736
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:57,520
This is kinda nice.

737
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,730
As of fiscal year 2011, they could monitor

738
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,540
1 billion telephones and internet sessions simultanously,

739
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,370
per one of these devices,

740
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,710
and they can collect at a rate of 125 Gigabytes a second,

741
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,590
which is a Terabit per second.

742
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,710
- That's for each one of these?

743
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,290
- That's for each one of these, yeah.

744
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,940
- How many TUMULT missions would that be then?

745
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,480
- Part of this, back then there were 20 sites,

746
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:25,750
there's ten at DOD installations.

747
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,720
But these are all outdated, we've expanded pretty rapidly.

748
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,460
But still 20 sites, that's at least 20 billion.

749
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,950
- This all need to get out. 
You know what I mean, it's like...

750
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:43,010
Just in terms of understanding, 
the capabilities, it's so opaque.

751
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,540
- It's not science fiction. 
This stuff is happening right now.

752
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,920
- No, that's what I mean, it's like... 
The magnitude of it,

753
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:52,990
and like this a pretty inaccessible 
technical document.

754
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,690
But, even this it's really chilling, 
you know what I mean?

755
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,710
Yeah, I mean, we should be having debates

756
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,910
about whether we want Government

757
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,750
I mean this is massive and extraordinary. 
It's amazing...

758
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,340
Even though you know it...
Even though you know that...

759
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,280
to see it like the physical blueprints of it

760
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,430
and sort of the technical expressions of it,

761
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:19,485
brutally hits home like...
in a super visceral way that is so needed.

<font color="#FFFF00">Explain for our viewers 
why this is important?</font>

773
00:44:58,310 --> 00:45:00,010
<font color="#FFFF00">It's important because people have understood</font>

774
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,780
<font color="#FFFF00">that the law that this was done under, 
which is the Patriot Act</font>

775
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,620
<font color="#FFFF00">enacted in the wake of 9/11.</font>

776
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,480
<font color="#FFFF00">Was a law that allowed the government 
very broad powers to get records</font>

777
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:14,060
<font color="#FFFF00">about people with a lower level of suspicion 
and probable cause to traditional standards.</font>

778
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:16,430
<font color="#FFFF00">So it has always been assumed 
that under the Patriot Act,</font>

779
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,850
<font color="#FFFF00">if the government had even any suspicion 
that you where involved</font>

780
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,270
<font color="#FFFF00">in a crime or terrorism, 
they could get a lot of information about you.</font>

781
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,500
<font color="#FFFF00">What this court order does 
that makes it so striking</font>

782
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,420
<font color="#FFFF00">is that it's not directed at any individuals 
who they believe or have suspicion of</font>

783
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,950
<font color="#FFFF00">committing crime or a part of 
a terrorist organization.</font>

784
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:37,980
<font color="#FFFF00">It's collecting the phone records of 
every single customer of Verizon business</font>

785
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,500
<font color="#FFFF00">and finding out every single call 
that they've made internationally and locally.

786
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:45,390
<font color="#FFFF00">So it's indiscriminant and it's sweeping.
It's a Government program designed</font>

787
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,400
<font color="#FFFF00">to collect information about all Americans</font>

788
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,960
<font color="#FFFF00">not just people 
where they believe there is reason to think</font>

789
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,240
<font color="#FFFF00">they've done anything wrong.</font>

790
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,530
It's a tough situation

791
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,990
You know hearing that

792
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,060
the person that you love 
that you've spent the decade with

793
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,210
may not be coming back.

794
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,280
- What did they ask her?

795
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,910
- Hum... When was the last time she saw me?

796
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,380
Where am I?

797
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,160
What am I doing?

798
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,240
Hum.. you know.

799
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,300
What does she know about my illness?

800
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,820
Things like that.

801
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:27,080
So yeah they're pretty solidly aware.

802
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,260
Cause she's...

803
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:32,420
I'm clearly not at home ill.

804
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,190
- Hello, hello

805
00:47:56,590 --> 00:47:59,600
- Hello, let me disconnect 
from the Internet.

806
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,650
- So there is some news?

807
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:07,780
- Yes there was indeed some news.

808
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:12,300
- I have config today, I think, 
maybe just a few hours ago.

809
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,030
- What kind of people does it...?

810
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:23,420
- An HR lady I'm assuming from NSA 
as opposed to Booz Allen.

811
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:25,450
Because she has was accompanied by a police officer

812
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:28,800
which mean the NSA police 
and they're planning to break into my house

813
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,640
which regular police don't do.

814
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,340
- Does she lives there?

815
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,700
- Yeah she lives there so I told her to cooperate fully

816
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:38,760
I can't find my phone just one second.

817
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,300
and don't worry about herself

818
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:42,700
You know what I gonna do, 
I'll just take out the stuff I want to use.

819
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:43,930
- OK

820
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:47,290
- OK well look I mean this is not a surprise at all.

821
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,500
- Not yeah I know I planned for it but it's just you know 
when it's impacting

822
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,900
and when they're talking to you 
it's a little bit different.

823
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:53,850
- Absolutely

824
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:59,140
- But it's possible that they just noticed 
that you're missing

825
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,640
I guess it's not really possible.

826
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:05,760
- It is but yeah they're I mean

827
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,840
Hum... let me just get rid of this.

828
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:16,810
So I obviously was focused on other things 
than appearance this morning.

829
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,930
- How was she? How does she reacted? 
Was she relatively calm about it?

830
00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:23,310
- She's relatively calm.

831
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,180
- Does she know anything about what you're doing?

832
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:27,510
- She has, she has no idea

833
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:31,550
and that's I mean I feel badly about that

834
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,590
but that's the only way I could think of where

835
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,040
like she can't be in trouble.

836
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:37,900
- Did you just basically do a 
"I have to go somewhere for reasons

837
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,750
that I can't tell you about" kind of thing?

838
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:42,140
- I just disappeared when she was on vacation

839
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,770
and I left a note saying

840
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,020
"Hey I'm gonna be away for a while for work"

841
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,260
which isn't unusual for me in my business

842
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,320
- Right

843
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,140
you know so

844
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,620
- OK so let me ask a couple things just quickly.

845
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,050
Are they gonna be able to go into your stuff 
and figure out what you took?

846
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:06,460
- Hum in some kind of some sort of like 
peripheral sense but not necessarily

847
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,610
- Yes because I cast such a wide net

848
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:12,900
I they do that the only thing they're gonna do 
is they're gonna have a heart attack

849
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,960
because they're gonna go 
"He had access to everything"

850
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:15,680
- Yeah

851
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:19,130
and they not gonna know what 
specifically has been done.

852
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:22,240
I think they're gonna start to actually feel a little better

853
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,070
although they're not gonna be wild about this in any case.

854
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,540
When they see that the stories are kind of cleaving to a trend

855
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:30,730
you know it's not like

856
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,940
"Here is the list of everybody who works everywhere"

857
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:33,960
- Right

858
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:36,870
- I also think you know there're gonna be 
paranoid in the extreme

859
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,020
and assuming all kind of 
worst case scenarios

860
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,010
which is gonna you know I think

861
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:46,550
make them react in ways that probably aren't like 
gonna be particularly

862
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,880
rational on their part

863
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,630
but at the same time there's... 
I do think they're limited

864
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,970
for the moment.

865
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:58,440
- I agree and I mean, 
I had kind of time to set a stage where

866
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,920
we all enjoy at least a minimum 
level of protection you know

867
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:03,710
no matter who we are who's involved in this 
you know you're either a journalist

868
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,540
- Right

869
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,030
or you're either out of jurisdiction

870
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:08,740
so we have some time to play this 
before they can really get nasty.

871
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,230
I think it's over you know the weeks 
when they have times to get lawyers,

872
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:12,920
really sort of go

873
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,790
"This is a special situation 
how can we interpret this to our advantage?"

874
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,710
like we seen them do this all the time you know

875
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:21,480
whether it's drones or wiretapping 
or whatever they'll go.

876
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,960
Well according to this law 
from the 1840's you know

877
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:26,410
- Yeah yeah of course

878
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,340
we can apply x, y to the Authority.

879
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,540
But that takes time and that takes agreement.

880
00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:31,580
Yeah and also you know I mean I think

881
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,290
the more public we are out there 
to like as journalists

882
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,560
and the more protection 
it's gonna give as well.

883
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:42,180
- Have you started to give thoughts 
to when you're ready to come forward?

884
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:48,430
- I'm ready whenever huh honestly 
I think there is sort of an agreement

885
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,100
that it's not going to bias 
the reporting process.

886
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,310
That's my primary concern at this point.

887
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,090
I don't want to get myself into the issue 
before it's gonna happen anyway

888
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,110
and where it takes away 
for the stories that are getting out.

889
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,035
We're talking about tens of millions 
of Americans

890
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,060
who weren't suspected of doing anything

891
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:45,190
who were surveilled in this way.

892
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,780
...thoughts for a moment, I want to 
continue this conversation,

893
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,600
these are really important sensitive issues

894
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,170
and the public out there has the right 
to know what's going on... Stand by...

895
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,020
<font color="#FFFF00">This is CNN breaking news</font>

896
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,820
<font color="#FFFF00">Another explosive article has just appeared 
this time in the Washington Post</font>

897
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:06,380
<font color="#FFFF00">it's breaking news and it reveals another 
broad and secret US government surveillance program.</font>

898
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:11,650
<font color="#FFFF00">The Washington Post and The Guardian in London
reporting that the NSA and the FBI</font>

899
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:17,070
<font color="#FFFF00">are tapping directly into the 
central servers of nine leading Internet companies</font>

900
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:23,120
<font color="#FFFF00">including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, 
Facebook, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.</font>

901
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:27,830
<font color="#FFFF00">Reports says they're extracting audio, 
video, photographs, e-mails, documents</font>

902
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:33,990
<font color="#FFFF00">and connection logs that enable analysts
to track a person's movements and context over time.</font>

903
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,400
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's discuss this latest revelation 
that coming out fast,</font>

904
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:41,180
<font color="#FFFF00">Bill Binney, the formal official of the NSA</font>

905
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,310
<font color="#FFFF00">who quit back in 2001, you were angry about 
what was going on</font>

906
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:46,410
<font color="#FFFF00">you've been known as 
a whistleblower right now.</font>

907
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,590
<font color="#FFFF00">- Bill, what do you think about 
this Washington Post story?</font>

908
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:52,060
<font color="#FFFF00">- Well, I assume it's just the continuation 
of what they've been doing all along.</font>

909
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,200
<font color="#FFFF00">- So you're not surprised?</font>

910
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,260
<font color="#FFFF00">- No</font>

911
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:55,990
<font color="#FFFF00">- Do you have any idea who's leaking this information?</font>

912
00:53:56,260 --> 00:53:58,090
<font color="#FFFF00">- I don't know who leaked this,</font>

913
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,460
<font color="#FFFF00">I have no doubt that the administration will 
launch an investigation</font>

914
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:06,500
<font color="#FFFF00">not into who approved these programs 
but into who leaked the information.</font>

915
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:10,550
I'm not shocked they come to denying it, I don't assume that...

916
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,770
- Do you believe it?

917
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,100
<font color="#FFFF00">- There're maybe some technical basis on which 
they can say that we are not</font>

918
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:19,590
<font color="#FFFF00">actively collaborating or they don't have 
what we consider in our definition</font>

919
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:23,000
<font color="#FFFF00">to be direct access to our servers 
but what I do know is that I've talked to</font>

920
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:25,110
<font color="#FFFF00">more that one person</font>

921
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,010
<font color="#FFFF00">who has sat at a desk at a web portal 
and typed out commands</font>

922
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:32,920
<font color="#FFFF00">and reached into those servers 
from a distance.</font>

923
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,690
<font color="#FFFF00">So, whatever they want to call that, 
that's what's happening.</font>

924
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:40,080
Hold on, what are we calling the 
single biggest infringement on American civil liberties

925
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,050
probably of all time, isn't it?

926
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:46,530
<font color="#FFFF00">- ...we already have the New York Times now today
saying that the Administration has lost all credibility.</font>

927
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,700
<font color="#FFFF00">- The New York Times slammed 
President Obama for this</font>

928
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,090
<font color="#FFFF00">and frankly I was used to that</font>

929
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,560
<font color="#FFFF00">the New York Times used to slam George Bush
for protecting the country for the steps he took.</font>

930
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,220
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want us to drop our guard.</font>

931
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,400
I don't want us to be struck again as we saw in Boston,

932
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,660
I understand,

933
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:03,790
<font color="#FFFF00">people are willing to sacrifice their 
civil liberties, people are sheltered inside which is enough...</font>

934
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,350
- How can you believe in freedom, do you see?

935
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,420
I mean try and play the devil's advocate for me, 
when you have secret courts,

936
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:13,170
secret operations like PRISM, secret investigations which go into

937
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,590
every spit and cough of every American's lives without any Member 
of the American public

938
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,590
knowing about it. That's not freedom is it?

939
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:23,850
<font color="#FFFF00">- In 2008, they eliminated the 
warrant requirement for all conversations</font>

940
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,840
<font color="#FFFF00">except ones that takes place 
by and among Americans</font>

941
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:28,960
exclusively on America's soil.

942
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,280
So they don't need warrants now for people 
who are foreigners

943
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,630
outside of the US but they also don't need 
warrants for Americans

944
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,980
who are in the United States 
communicating with people

945
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,550
reasonably believed to be 
outside of the US.

946
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,610
So again, the fact that there are no checks, 
no oversight about who's looking over the NSA's shoulder,

947
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,580
means that they can take whatever they want 
and the fact that it's all behind a wall

948
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:51,990
of secrecy and they threaten people 
who want to expose it

949
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,400
means that whatever they're doing 
even violating the law

950
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,330
is something we're unlikely to know 
until we start having real investigations

951
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,270
and real transparency into 
what it is the government is doing.

952
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,170
<font color="#FFFF00">Glenn Greenwald, congratulations again 
on exposing what is a true scandal,</font>

953
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,630
I appreciate you joining me.

954
00:56:56,350 --> 00:57:01,760
Hey I just heard from Lindsay and huh... 
she's still alive, which is good and free.

955
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:06,690
My rent checks apparently are no longer 
getting through to my landlord

956
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,200
so they said if we don't pay them 
in five days we will be evicted,

957
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,760
which is strange because I got a system 
set up that automatically pays them.

958
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,080
So there is that apparently there is 
construction trucks all over the street

959
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,750
of my house, so that's, I wonder 
what they're looking for.

960
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:17,680
It is... It is an unusual feeling 
that's kind of hard to...

961
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,260
hard to like, describe or convey in words 
but not knowing what's gonna happen

962
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,540
in the next days, the next hour 
or the next week

963
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:30,810
it's scary but at the same time 
it's liberating, you know,

964
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,460
the planning comes a lot easier 
because you don't have

965
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,760
that many variables to take into plate, 
you can only act, and then act again.

966
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,300
Now all these phone calls 
are being recorded digitally

967
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,170
not for content but 
for origin and destination

968
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,320
now word the government is going right into 
the servers of these large Internet companies.

969
00:58:49,110 --> 00:58:53,080
- How does the government politically speaking 
make the argument that this is essential

970
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,920
to National Security and not 
a dramatic overreach

971
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,870
in terms of personal privacy?

972
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:02,170
- It's difficult Matt, because 
as Peter was pointing out, overnight

973
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,970
we had an extraordinary late night 
close to midnight announcement

974
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,680
and a declassification from the 
Director of National Intelligence.

975
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:12,890
They are scrambling, the Administration is 
already supported strongly by leaders

976
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,260
in both parties from the 
Intelligence Committees.

977
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:21,120
GCHQ has an internal Wikipedia at the top secret
you know, super classified level

978
00:59:22,170 --> 00:59:24,350
where anybody working intelligence 
can work on anything they want.

979
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:29,900
That's what this is, I'm giving it to you, 
you can make the decision on that what's appropriate what's not.

980
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:32,050
Hum it's gonna be documents of, 
you know, different types,

981
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:35,240
pictures and Power Points and Word documents.
Stuff like that ...

982
00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:37,040
- Sorry can I take that seat?

983
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:38,250
- Yeah

984
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,360
- Sorry, I'm sorry I've got used to repeat, 
so in these documents, they will show...

985
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,290
- Yeah there will be 
a couple more documents on that,

986
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,490
that's only one part though, 
like it talks about Tempora

987
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:52,280
and a little more thing 
that's the wiki article itself.

988
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:59,250
It was also talking about a self-developed tool 
called UDAQ U.D.A.Q. it's their search tool

989
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,840
for all the stuff they collect 
was what it looked like.

990
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:02,530
- Yeah

991
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,540
- Hum it's gonna be projects, 
it's gonna be troubleshooting pages

992
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:07,080
for a particular tool.

993
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:08,010
- Thanks

994
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:12,500
- And, the next step, 
when do you think you'll go public?

995
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:17,850
- Arh... I think it's pretty soon, 
I mean, with the reaction, this escalated more quickly,

996
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:20,900
I think pretty much as soon as they 
start trying to make this about me

997
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:22,630
which should be any day now.

998
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:23,480
- Yeah

999
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:29,160
- Hum I'll come out just to go hey, 
you know, this is not a question of

1000
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:32,500
somebody skulking around in the shadows. 
These are public issues,

1001
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:35,680
these are not my issues 
you know these are everybody's issues,

1002
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:39,650
I'm not afraid of you, you know, 
you're not gonna bully me in the silence

1003
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,680
like you've done to everybody else

1004
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,730
and if no body else is gonna do it I will

1005
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:47,000
and hopefully when I'm gone 
whatever you do to me,

1006
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:49,180
there will be somebody else 
who will do the same thing.

1007
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:52,410
It will be the sort of Internet principle 
you know, of the Hydra:

1008
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,360
you can stop one person 
but there is gonna be seven more of us.

1009
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:57,640
- Yeah

1010
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,460
Are you getting more nervous?

1011
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,180
- I mean...  no. I think the way 
I look at stress... particularly because

1012
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:18,000
I sort of knew this was coming...
because I sort of volunteered to walk into it.

1013
01:01:21,790 --> 01:01:25,640
I'm already sort of familiar with the idea.

1014
01:01:25,830 --> 01:01:26,910
I'm not worried about it.

1015
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:29,180
When somebody like 
busts in the door suddenly

1016
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:30,100
I'll get nervous and it'll affect me
but until they do, you know...

1017
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:31,480
- Yeah, yeah.

1018
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:34,130
But until they do umm... you know.

1019
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:37,340
I'm eating a little less 
that's the only difference I think.

1020
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,640
- Let's talk about the issue with when we're gonna say 
who you are.

1021
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:49,400
- Yeah

1022
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:54,420
- This is, you know, you have to talk me through this 
because I have a big worry about this.

1023
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:55,430
- OK tell me

1024
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:59,010
- Which is that...
if we come out and

1025
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:04,620
I know that you believe 
that your detection is inevitable

1026
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,740
and that it's inevitable imminently.

1027
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:09,900
There is, you know, in the New York Times 
today Charlie Savage the fascinating

1028
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:13,150
Sherlock Holmes of political reporting deduced that

1029
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:15,980
the fact that there has been these leaks in succession

1030
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:18,610
probably means that there's some one person 
that decided to leak...

1031
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,970
- Somebody else quoted you saying 
it was one of your readers

1032
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,780
- Yeah

1033
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,390
- And somebody else is putting on things

1034
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,600
- Yeah so you know, I mean it's fine 
I want people to, I wanted to be like

1035
01:02:27,970 --> 01:02:28,440
- Yeah

1036
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:31,380
- You know like this is a person, 
I want to start introducing the concept of

1037
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,010
this is a person who has a particular set 
of political objectives

1038
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:37,270
about informing the world about 
what's taking place.

1039
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:40,980
Like you know, 
I'm keeping it all anonymous totally

1040
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,770
but I want to start introducing you 
in that kind of incremental way.

1041
01:02:45,930 --> 01:02:47,110
But here's the thing.

1042
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:50,290
What I'm concerned about it 
that if come out and say

1043
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:52,660
here's who this is, here's what he did 
the whole thing

1044
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,720
that we talked about.

1045
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:56,170
Then we're gonna basically be doing 
the government's work for them

1046
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:59,570
and we're gonna basically be handing them 
you know a confession

1047
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:03,600
and helping them identify who find it.

1048
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,890
I mean maybe you're right, 
maybe they'll find out quickly

1049
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,600
and maybe they'll know but is there 
any possible idea that they won't?

1050
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:13,170
Are we kind of giving them stuff 
that we don't...? Or...

1051
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:16,530
- It's possible that they already know 
but they don't want to reveal

1052
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,740
it because they don't know...

1053
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:20,250
- Or that they don't know 
and we're gonna be telling them like

1054
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,700
is it a possibility that 
they're gonna need like 2 3 months or uncertainty

1055
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:25,710
and we're gonna be 
solving their problem for them?

1056
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,390
or let me just say the or part 
maybe it doesn't matter to you,

1057
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,370
maybe you want it, maybe, I mean,

1058
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,430
you're not coming out because

1059
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,530
you think inevitably 
they're gonna catch you

1060
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:38,110
and you want to do it first,

1061
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,460
you're coming out because 
you want to fucking come out and...

1062
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,710
- Oh there is that, 
I mean that's the thing,

1063
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:45,140
I don't want to hide on this 
and skulk around,

1064
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:46,760
I don't think I should have to

1065
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,190
obviously there is circumstances 
that are saying that.

1066
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,120
I think it is powerful 
to come out and be like

1067
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:56,050
look I'm not afraid and I don't think 
other people should either,

1068
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,090
you know, I was sitting 
in the office right next to you last week,

1069
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,900
we all have a stake in this, 
this is our country

1070
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:06,030
and the balance of power 
between the citizenry and the government

1071
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:08,950
is becoming that 
of the ruling and the ruled

1072
01:04:09,270 --> 01:04:12,890
as opposed to actually, you know, 
the elected and the electorate.

1073
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,250
- OK so that's what I need to hear, 
that this is not about...

1074
01:04:17,310 --> 01:04:20,520
- But I do want to say, 
I don't think there is a case

1075
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,870
that I'm not gonna be discovered, 
in the fullness of time.

1076
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,510
It's just a question of time for me.

1077
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,230
You're right, it could take them 
a long time, I don't think it will

1078
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:31,870
but I didn't try to hide the footprint 
because again I intended to come forward.

1079
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:36,630
- OK I'm gonna post this morning 
just a general defense of whistleblowers

1080
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:40,070
and you in particular 
without saying anything about you.

1081
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:41,420
I'm gonna go post 
that right when I get back

1082
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,190
and I'm also doing like a big fuck you 
to all the people who keep like talking

1083
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,490
about investigations like that. 
I want that to be like...

1084
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,190
the fearlessness and the fuck you to like 
the bullying tactics,

1085
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,490
has go to be completely preventing 
every thing we do.

1086
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,350
- I think that's brilliant. 
I mean your principles on this I love,

1087
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,030
I can't support them enough because it is, 
it's inverting the model

1088
01:05:03,450 --> 01:05:05,500
of the government has laid out 
where people where trying to,

1089
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,380
you know, say the truth, skulk around, 
and then hide in the dark,

1090
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,890
and then quote anonymously. 
I say yes, fuck that, let's just...

1091
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,930
- OK, so here is the plan then, 
I mean, and this is a thing, it's like

1092
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:19,470
once, I think we all just felt the fact 
that this is the right way to do it.

1093
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:23,030
You feel the power of your choice, 
you know what I mean,

1094
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,780
it's like I want that power 
to be felt in the world.

1095
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:26,580
- OK

1096
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:30,000
- and it is the... 
it's the ultimate standing up to them

1097
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:33,390
right like I'm not gonna fucking hide 
even for one second,

1098
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,090
I'm gonna get right in your face,

1099
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,790
you don't have to investigate, 
there's nothing to investigate,

1100
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,400
here I am!

1101
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,050
You know, and I think that 
is just incredibly powerful,

1102
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:46,160
and then the question just becomes

1103
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:48,750
how do we do this in the right, 
you know the perfect way,

1104
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,820
that's my burden and 
that's what I'm gonna spend...

1105
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:54,150
So today it's gonna be 
this story in the morning,

1106
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,380
assuming that 
it doesn't change in The Guardian,

1107
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,730
it's gonna be this story in the morning,

1108
01:05:57,890 --> 01:06:00,820
just to keep the mental going, 
just to keep like the disclosures coming.

1109
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,930
A big one at night, now it's becoming like

1110
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,730
"OK, this is a major leak"

1111
01:06:06,970 --> 01:06:09,260
and after today when we post 
the two stuff things that we're gonna post.

1112
01:06:10,050 --> 01:06:14,390
It's gonna be 
"what the fuck is this leak and who did it?"

1113
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:15,730
I guarantee you.

1114
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,910
I just want to make sure, 
move over slightly...

1115
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,420
- Do you want me to move 
a little move over...

1116
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:31,200
- I just wanna move... all right

1117
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:35,370
- OK

1118
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,230
- We are ready

1119
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,650
- So let's us begin with some basic

1120
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,050
background information like

1121
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,350
just state your name,

1122
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,900
what position you held 
in intelligence community

1123
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:45,200
and how long you worked 
within that community

1124
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:50,120
- OK, uh... just some... 
how are we going, like,

1125
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,470
in depth or 
are we going like in general,

1126
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:53,530
like I'm currently 
an infrastructure analyst, you know,

1127
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:56,190
Booz Allen Hamilton, 
not going through my whole back story

1128
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:57,020
- Yes

1129
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:57,830
- OK,

1130
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:59,060
- Just like summary kind of

1131
01:06:59,290 --> 01:06:59,920
- OK

1132
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,040
- My Name is Ed Snowden, 
I'm 29 years old,

1133
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:07,070
I work for Booz Allen Hamilton 
as an infrastructure analyst

1134
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:09,550
for NSA in Hawaii.

1135
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,480
- And what are some of the positions 
that you held previously

1136
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,260
within the intelligence community?

1137
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:18,870
- I've been a system engineer, 
system administrator, uh...

1138
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:25,240
senior advisor, uh... 
for the, Central Intelligence Agency,

1139
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:29,120
solutions consultant and a 
telecommunications information

1140
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,080
systems officer.

1141
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,380
- And what kind of clearances have... 
have you held,

1142
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,780
what kinda classification?

1143
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,770
- Uh... Top secret,

1144
01:07:42,010 --> 01:07:45,090
So, people in my levels of access 
for systems administration

1145
01:07:45,730 --> 01:07:50,050
or as a infrastructure analyst 
typically have higher accesses

1146
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:53,600
than an NSA employee would normally have.

1147
01:07:54,050 --> 01:07:56,870
Normal NSA employees have a 
combination of clearances called

1148
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:01,080
TS SI TK and Gamma.

1149
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,380
Uh, that's a Top Secret Signals 
Intelligence Talent Keyhole

1150
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:07,680
and Gamma.

1151
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:11,580
And they all relate to certain things 
that are sort of core to the NSA mission.

1152
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:15,540
As a systems administrator 
you get a special clearance

1153
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:18,250
called PrivAcc 
for Privileged Access,

1154
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:22,440
which allows you to be exposed 
to informations of any classification

1155
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:25,560
regardless of what 
your position actually needs.

1156
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:48,180
Monday

1157
01:08:48,410 --> 01:08:51,090
June 10, 2013

1158
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,380
Just before we go, 
a remind of our top story,

1159
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:05,740
and that's the full map, 
CIA typically worked at Edward Snowden

1160
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:11,360
says he's responsible for leaking information 
that US authorities have been monitoring

1161
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,750
phone and Internet data.

1162
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,000
The US justice deparment confirmed 
it is the first stages

1163
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:19,510
of a criminal investigation.

1164
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:22,060
- Leave it long or got it shorter, 
what do you think?

1165
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:25,270
As far as the video the people saw. 
Am I less identifiable now?

1166
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:26,050
- lose it?

1167
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,740
- lose it? Cause I can't go 
all the way down, it's still gonna be stubble.

1168
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:32,230
I don't have the blade for closer.

1169
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,890
- Will you be talking 
to any other media about this story today?

1170
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:38,430
- I am.

1171
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,780
- Uh, will you be coming to our office

1172
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,800
- ... about where is Snowden now, what his plans are?

1173
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,010
- No, I won't talk about that, 
so unless you have any other questions...

1174
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:47,710
- OK

1175
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:51,250
- What are you plans please? 
Are you staying in Hong Kong

1176
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,260
for a the time being?

1177
01:09:52,510 --> 01:09:53,240
- For a little while.

1178
01:09:53,470 --> 01:09:56,080
- And do you have any hopes 
to write more about this story

1179
01:09:56,330 --> 01:09:58,480
or are you stopping 
new writing about this story?

1180
01:09:58,690 --> 01:09:59,830
- No, I'm gonna continue 
to write about it.

1181
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:02,060
- Have you had any pressure 
from the US Authorities

1182
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:03,760
about continuing to report on this?

1183
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:04,660
- No.

1184
01:10:05,190 --> 01:10:07,220
- And have you heard anything about 
what could be...

1185
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:11,250
asked you the Hong Kong Authorities 
towards this case,

1186
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,590
whether they contacted you or asked you 
anything about the whereabouts of Snowden

1187
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,540
and whether that's just another...

1188
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:19,790
- I haven't heard about 
the Authorities of any Government.

1189
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,450
- And do, where do you think 
this story is going then?

1190
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:27,790
For you and of course for Snowden 
and of course for the US media

1191
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,410
and the US Administration in general?

1192
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,110
- Uh, for me, I'm gonna continue to report.

1193
01:10:31,930 --> 01:10:36,240
Reporting on what the Government has been doing 
and what I think people should know about.

1194
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,810
As for him I don't think anyone knows

1195
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:45,070
... people come after me or any of their third partners 
you know they work closely with a number of other nations

1196
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:51,080
or you know they could pay off the trial 
you know any of their agents are assets ...

1197
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:32,300
A criminal investigation the whistleblower... 
monitoring phone calls and Internet data goes public...

1198
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:37,600
Security forces in Afghanistan 
say a number of...

1199
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:43,940
Now it's time for our news paper review 
and looking at what's making headlines

1200
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:45,450
around the world.

1201
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:51,310
Let's start with The Guardian our top story 
which is revealing the identity of the former CIA employee.

1202
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:57,130
The paper says he leaks information exposing the scale 
of American's surveillance of the Internet.

1203
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:00,630
Edward Snowden, 
what a great story...

1204
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:05,550
Well I think it's a fantastic story this could be 
straight out from a John Le Carré novel

1205
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:08,420
I mean when you read what he did, 
yes he got the material,

1206
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:13,030
he then decided to go to a place he identified to be 
very difficult for America to get at him

1207
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:14,270
- God dammit

1208
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,830
which is Hong Kong because of course technically inside China, 
the one country two systems policy

1209
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,040
there meaning he would get potentially some protection,

1210
01:12:23,290 --> 01:12:26,540
he thought, all very well planned, 
could be just out of a spy novel.

1211
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:28,320
But what about the details.

1212
01:12:32,490 --> 01:12:41,000
- That could make it worse. 
But just the lower half of my face.

1213
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,180
Snowden says he'd become increasingly 
dismay by what he saw as the growing power

1214
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:20,580
of the NSA.

1215
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:24,030
And it's his decision to pass on 
documents which is said to reveal

1216
01:13:24,550 --> 01:13:28,570
the organisation monitored 
millions of phone calls

1217
01:13:28,810 --> 01:13:31,350
but that it had direct access 
to some of the...

1218
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,670
- How do you feel?

1219
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:33,940
...Internet companies in the world.

1220
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,500
- uuh what happens, happens. 
We've uh we've talked about this

1221
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:42,070
I knew what the risks and if I get arrested, 
I get arrested,

1222
01:13:45,310 --> 01:13:49,360
we were able to get the information 
that needed to get out, out.

1223
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:56,670
And you and Glenn are able to keep reporting 
regardless what happens to me.

1224
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:04,080
Now 29 year old Edward Snowden says that US intelligence agencies 
gathered millions of phone records

1225
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:07,230
and monitored Internet data...

1226
01:14:13,130 --> 01:14:14,920
- Yes. I'm sorry who's asking?

1227
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:22,550
- I'm afraid you have the wrong room thank you. 
Wall Street Journal.

1228
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,840
- Yes. I'm sorry say again?

1229
01:14:42,410 --> 01:14:43,940
Uh, no thank you. No calls.

1230
01:14:44,370 --> 01:14:45,960
I think they have the wrong number.

1231
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:48,930
Yeah, no calls. Thank you.

1232
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:55,620
Uh wait I'm sorry if it's two men from the front desk 
they can call but no outside calls.

1233
01:14:56,150 --> 01:15:01,090
Wait actually just... let them through. Wait, wait m'am?

1234
01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:02,100
Fuck

1235
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:19,550
- Yes. Wait is it a lawyer? Yeah, no no no I mean,

1236
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:26,670
the people who are asking. Ask them if they are lawyers.

1237
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:34,630
No tell her that she has the wrong number 
and there is no Mr. Snowden here.

1238
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:17,710
Would you mind to talk in speakerphone?

1239
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:19,920
- Sorry

1240
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:25,390
- Hi. I'm the client

1241
01:16:27,710 --> 01:16:29,700
- Pretty good. I'm doing well

1242
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:46,450
- Ok

1243
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:52,890
- Ok

1244
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:09,770
- Ok, that's great. Is it OK if i bring equipment? 
Because i'm just kind of going, so i can leave in any direction,

1245
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,620
at any time, and not come back. If necessary.

1246
01:17:23,450 --> 01:17:24,640
- Ok, that sounds good.

1247
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:27,890
- Thank you, thank you so much for helping us.

1248
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,720
- Yeah... And so, is there a precedent for this 
where Hong Kong would extradite someone

1249
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:16,490
for political speech ?

1250
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:26,120
"The President surely does not welcome 
the way that this debate

1251
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:28,030
has earned a greater attention 
the last week,

1252
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:31,710
the leaked classified information about 
sensitive programs that are

1253
01:19:31,980 --> 01:19:33,690
important in our 
fight against terrorists

1254
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:36,450
who would do harm 
to Americans is a problem,

1255
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,320
but the debate itself is legitimate 
and should be engaged.

1256
01:23:32,270 --> 01:23:34,570
- Right, so which one do we want here then.

1257
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,260
This is operational stuff, 
so we mustn't say any of this.

1258
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:38,450
- So redact that.

1259
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,270
- Go near the top

1260
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,310
- What about the Alexander's quote, 
is that something ...

1261
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:46,320
- Yeah. That's in TARMAC. 
"Why can't we collect all the signals all the times?

1262
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:49,690
Sounds like a good 
summer homework project for Menwith"

1263
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,000
Keith Alexander the head of the NSA 
on a visit to the UK. This one.

1264
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:54,240
- Yeah.

1265
01:23:54,490 --> 01:23:57,870
- Yeah. It's a secret document 
in that secret document.

1266
01:23:58,110 --> 01:24:01,820
We've got a stick here 
that should just have three single slides on it.

1267
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:05,650
If it's got more than three single slides, 
we have to be extremely careful.

1268
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:09,120
- Yeah?

1269
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,360
- Yeah, that's it.

1270
01:24:10,900 --> 01:24:13,480
This is really dangerous stuff for us, Guardian

1271
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,000
If we make mistakes, ...very angry.

1272
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:19,680
We kept it all under lock and key
and no one knows. No, I'm not saying that.

1273
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:21,450
- OK

1274
01:24:21,730 --> 01:24:24,360
- They will come in and snap the front door down 
if we elaborate on that...

1275
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,220
And he said...

1276
01:24:26,590 --> 01:24:29,220
The Prime Minister is extremely concerned about this.

1277
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,530
And they kept saying, "this is from the very top."

1278
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,530
As you can see on this map 
the flight that probably has Snowden aboard,

1279
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:48,605
has almost reached its destination here 
in Moscow's scheduled plan,

1280
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,150
in the Russian capital within minutes...

1281
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:57,785
As you may have heard, there is a CIA agent 
who has revealed a lot of information

1282
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:00,720
and he is now trapped in the

1283
01:26:02,810 --> 01:26:03,960
airport in Moscow

1284
01:26:04,870 --> 01:26:06,380
We managed to get him out of Hong Kong,

1285
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:08,540
but when he landed in the Moscow airport,

1286
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:13,130
the American government had canceled his passport.

1287
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:16,180
So formally he hasn't entered into Russian territory,

1288
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,050
he is in the transit area of the airport

1289
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:22,330
And one of our people is accompanying him

1290
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:25,110
We are trying to arrange a private jet

1291
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,490
to take him from Moscow

1292
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:37,370
to Ecuador or perhaps maybe Venezuela

1293
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:38,630
or maybe Iceland,

1294
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:40,980
countries where he would be safe.

1295
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:15,260
May I collect all the phones please?

1296
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,400
I have everything in here

1297
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:29,100
Put them in the refrigerator

1298
01:30:39,890 --> 01:30:42,150
- So, as you know, in June,

1299
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:45,880
Snowden was in charge with 3

1300
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:47,160
legal violations felonies

1301
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:51,150
Principaly under a World War I era

1302
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:53,780
criminal law called the Espionage Act

1303
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:57,830
The Espionage Act is an extremely broad

1304
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:59,610
criminal prohibition against

1305
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:02,610
the sharing or dissemination

1306
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,780
of what's called 
"National Defense information"

1307
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:08,140
it was only used to

1308
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,580
prosecute people who had been accused of

1309
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:14,030
acting with a foreign power, 
spies not whistleblowers

1310
01:31:14,430 --> 01:31:16,550
and it's a very unusual legal 
representation I think

1311
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:19,740
not just for all of you, 
but for me as well.

1312
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:23,700
The Espionage Act has not 
distinguished between

1313
01:31:24,120 --> 01:31:25,990
leaks to the press 
and the public interest,

1314
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:28,630
and selling secrets to foreign enemies

1315
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:30,710
for personal profit.

1316
01:31:31,230 --> 01:31:32,720
So, under the Espionage Act

1317
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:36,070
it's not a defense if the information that was disclosed

1318
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,480
should not have been withheld 
in the first place,

1319
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:40,010
that it was improperly classified.

1320
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:43,600
It's not a defense if the 
dissemination was in the public interest

1321
01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,230
that it led to reforms.

1322
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:49,240
Even if the court determines 
that the programs that were revealed

1323
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:51,170
were illegal or unconstitutional.

1324
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:53,690
that's still not a defense under the Espionage Act,

1325
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:56,730
the Government doesn't have 
to defend the classification,

1326
01:31:57,050 --> 01:32:00,000
it doesn't have to demonstrate 
harm from the release,

1327
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,260
All this is irrelevant.

1328
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:05,420
So when we say that 
the trial wouldn't be fair,

1329
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,590
we are not talking about 
what human rights lawyers think

1330
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,240
of this fair trial practices

1331
01:32:10,550 --> 01:32:12,240
We are saying the law, the statute itself,

1332
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,980
eliminates any kind of defense

1333
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,000
that Snowden might be able to make

1334
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,700
and essentially will equate him with a spy.

1335
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:25,350
And of course those three counts 
could be increased to a hundreed or two hundreed

1336
01:32:25,650 --> 01:32:27,330
or three hundreed, they could charge him separately

1337
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:30,720
for each document that has been 
published by a journalist.

1338
01:32:31,240 --> 01:32:34,100
And I think that we all recognize, 
even though we sit here as lawyers

1339
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:36,520
in a lawyer's meeting

1340
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:41,600
that it's propably 
95% politics and 5% law.

1341
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,290
How this would be resolved.

1342
01:33:16,080 --> 01:33:19,280
"Mr. Snowden has been charged with very serious crimes

1343
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:23,140
and he should be returned to the United States 
where he would be granted full due process

1344
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:27,210
and every right available to him 
as a United States citizen.

1345
01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:31,330
Facing our justice system 
under the Constitution."

1346
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:24,140
No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a Patriot.

1347
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:26,840
I called for a federal review

1348
01:34:27,630 --> 01:34:30,380
of our surveillance operations

1349
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:33,330
before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.

1350
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:35,260
My preference,

1351
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:38,400
and I think the American people's preference,

1352
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:42,130
would have been for a lawful, orderly

1353
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:44,750
examination of these laws.

1354
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:50,090
A thoughtful, fact based debate,

1355
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:53,760
that would then lead us to a better place.

1356
01:35:35,290 --> 01:35:37,940
- Oh my God. David. Hello my baby.

1357
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:39,860
- I'm OK.

1358
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:41,310
- You're OK?

1359
01:35:46,040 --> 01:35:46,890
- I just wanna go home.

1360
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:50,510
- OK, OK OK. You just have to walk...

1361
01:35:57,400 --> 01:35:58,470
- How are you?

1362
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,170
- Good, good. I'm totally fine, I didn't sleep at all, I couldn't sleep.

1363
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,370
- I know.

1364
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:07,220
"Brazil Demands Explanation from UK Government"

1365
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:28,770
Recent reports have revealed that the NSA 
have access to encryption keys

1366
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:32,390
and they paid tech companies to introduce 
backdoors in encryption protocols

1367
01:36:33,170 --> 01:36:37,900
So we are going to talk about ways in which 
we can defend ourselves against

1368
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:40,270
governments spying on us.

1369
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,160
So Mr. Jacob Appelbaum, as an encryption and 
security software developper,

1370
01:36:44,370 --> 01:36:45,480
and journalist.

1371
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:49,030
Ladar Levison, the founder of the 
encrypted email service

1372
01:36:49,500 --> 01:36:50,850
Lavabit

1373
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:52,170
used by Edward Snowden.

1374
01:36:52,350 --> 01:36:53,060
You have the floor.

1375
01:36:53,470 --> 01:36:54,380
Thank you

1376
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:57,180
Lavabit is an email service 
that hopefully one day

1377
01:36:57,430 --> 01:37:02,970
will be able to stand on its own 
without any references to Snowden.

1378
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:06,220
My service was designed to remove me

1379
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:09,370
from the possibility of being forced

1380
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:11,630
to violate a person's privacy.

1381
01:37:11,980 --> 01:37:12,870
Quite simply

1382
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,400
Lavabit was designed to remove the service provider

1383
01:37:15,670 --> 01:37:16,920
from the equation,

1384
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,390
by not having logs on my server

1385
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:23,100
and not having access to 
a person's emails on disk,

1386
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:24,420
I wasn't elimitating

1387
01:37:24,690 --> 01:37:25,850
the possibility of surveillance,

1388
01:37:26,140 --> 01:37:29,200
I was simply removing myself 
from that equation.

1389
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,130
And that surveillance 
would have to be conducted

1390
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:33,730
on the target

1391
01:37:34,020 --> 01:37:35,120
either the sender

1392
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:37,040
or the receiver of the messages.

1393
01:37:37,780 --> 01:37:41,190
But I was approached 
by the FBI quite recently,

1394
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:42,510
and told

1395
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:45,190
that because I couldn't 
turn over the information

1396
01:37:45,470 --> 01:37:47,180
from that one particular user,

1397
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:49,490
I would be forced to 
give up those SSL keys

1398
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,640
and let the FBI 
collect every communication

1399
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:54,200
on my network without 
any kind of transparency.

1400
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,550
And of course,

1401
01:37:57,850 --> 01:37:59,420
I wasn't comfortable with that,

1402
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,070
to say the least!

1403
01:38:01,810 --> 01:38:06,140
More disturbing was the fact that 
I couldn't even tell anybody that it was going on.

1404
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,370
So I decided:

1405
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,440
"If I didn't win the fight to unseal my case,

1406
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,070
if I didn't win the battle

1407
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:15,970
to be able to tell people 
what was going on,

1408
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:19,630
then my only ethical choice left 
was to shutdown".

1409
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,120
Think about that.

1410
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:29,100
I believe in the rule of law, 
I believe in the need to conduct investigations,

1411
01:38:30,170 --> 01:38:33,890
but those investigations 
are supposed to be difficult for a reason.

1412
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:38,070
It's supposed to be difficult 
to invade somebody's privacy.

1413
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:40,730
Because of how intrusive it is,

1414
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,310
because of how disruptive it is.

1415
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:46,290
If we can't, if we don't have 
a right to privacy,

1416
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:49,390
how do we have 
a free and open discussion?

1417
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:51,960
What good is the right 
to free speech,

1418
01:38:54,430 --> 01:38:56,740
if it's not protected,

1419
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,230
in a sense that you can't have 
a private discussion

1420
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:02,250
with somebody else 
about something you disagree with.

1421
01:39:02,990 --> 01:39:05,000
Think about the chilling effect 
that that has.

1422
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,300
Think about the chilling effect 
it does have

1423
01:39:07,740 --> 01:39:10,760
on countries that don't have 
a right to privacy.

1424
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:13,130
I've noticed a really interesting 
discussion point

1425
01:39:13,490 --> 01:39:15,720
which is that what people used to call 
liberty and freedom

1426
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:17,350
we now call privacy.

1427
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,210
And we say in the same breath

1428
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:22,130
that privacy is dead.

1429
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,620
This is something 
that really concerns me

1430
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:25,900
about my generation

1431
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:28,780
especially when we talk about 
how we're not surprised by anything.

1432
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:30,560
I think that we should consider that

1433
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:32,840
when we lose privacy we lose agency,

1434
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:34,270
we lose liberty itself

1435
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:36,810
because we no longer feel free 
to express what we think.

1436
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,630
There is this myth of 
the passive surveillance machine

1437
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:42,580
but actually what is surveillance 
except control?

1438
01:39:43,140 --> 01:39:44,760
This notion that the NSA are passive

1439
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,840
this is nonsense

1440
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:47,290
what we see is that they actively attack

1441
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,350
European citizens, American citizens and,

1442
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:51,740
in fact, anyone that they can

1443
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:53,060
if they perceive an advantage.

1444
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,970
- OK. Right.

1445
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:39,890
- I have to give that in testimony.

1446
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:41,630
- What are you going to tell?

1447
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:45,130
- Everything I can truthfully.

1448
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,550
- What will you talk about?

1449
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:50,380
- Uh, whatever the questions they ask me.

1450
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:51,540
- Yeah I think it's over there.

1451
01:41:51,770 --> 01:41:54,950
- Ok, it's alright. Thank you.

1452
01:42:01,450 --> 01:42:02,750
- Hey, how are you?

1453
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:03,530
- Good.

1454
01:42:03,740 --> 01:42:04,230
- How are you?

1455
01:42:04,430 --> 01:42:04,990
- Good to see you again.

1456
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:06,340
- Nice to meet you again, yes.

1457
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:08,820
- Yeah

1458
01:43:37,710 --> 01:43:41,580
- What do you think they're doing to reporters, 
those of us that are working directly with...

1459
01:43:42,190 --> 01:43:43,500
Snowden documents?

1460
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:45,800
How do you think they would approach 
dealing with people like us?

1461
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:49,220
- You're.. You're on a cast iron cover list.

1462
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:53,150
Which means any electronic device you use

1463
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:56,275
that they can attach to you 
they all record and capture all that data.

1464
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:59,650
- And what do they do with that data? 
They're just trying to figure out what we're doing?

1465
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,750
- Uh, well the primary...

1466
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:04,630
That's part of it. But the other part, primarily part,

1467
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,140
is for them. I think it's to find the 
sources of information you're getting.

1468
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:11,540
- So if I have a confidential source 
who's giving me information as a whistleblower,

1469
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:14,930
and he works within the US Government, 
and he's concerned about

1470
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:18,180
what he perceives as 
violation of the Constitution,

1471
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,770
uhm... and he gets in touch with me, 
they...

1472
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:21,610
- Yeah...

1473
01:44:21,950 --> 01:44:22,710
- Go ahead. Yeah.

1474
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:26,350
- Yeah. From there on, they would nail him 
and start watching everything he did.

1475
01:44:28,210 --> 01:44:30,320
and if you start passing data,
I'm sure they'd take him off the street.

1476
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:33,760
I mean, the way you have to do it 
is like Deep Throat did, right?

1477
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:37,610
In the Nixon years, 
meet in a basement of a parking garage...

1478
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:39,660
physically.

1479
01:45:20,620 --> 01:45:23,000
Let's disassociate our metadata one last time.

1480
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:26,350
So we don't have a clear record of your true name 
in our final communication chain.

1481
01:45:28,740 --> 01:45:31,300
This is obviously not to say 
you can't claim your involvement,

1482
01:45:31,470 --> 01:45:33,820
but as every trick in the book 
is likely to be used and looking into this,

1483
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:37,500
I believe it's better, 
that that particular disclosure

1484
01:45:37,700 --> 01:45:39,230
come on your own terms.

1485
01:45:39,680 --> 01:45:42,130
Thank you again for all you've done.

1486
01:45:42,390 --> 01:45:44,170
So sorry again for the multiple delays.

1487
01:45:44,350 --> 01:45:45,870
But we've been entering a territory

1488
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:47,560
with no model to benefit from.

1489
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:50,540
If all ends well,

1490
01:45:50,920 --> 01:45:53,060
perhaps the demonstration that our mess has worked

1491
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:55,270
would embolden more to come forward

1492
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,520
Citizen.

1493
01:46:02,510 --> 01:46:06,420
- So the update that I want to give you is about the new,

1494
01:46:08,330 --> 01:46:10,410
uh.. the new source that, that we...

1495
01:46:11,810 --> 01:46:12,870
- OK.

1496
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:18,960
- that... uh, this is what... this is the...

1497
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:23,120
you know this is the person who is doing 
the... the most of the...

1498
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:24,340
- Right, right, right.

1499
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:28,320
- ...the work on it, uh... 
And now... and now,

1500
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,230
what basically, what happens is...

1501
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:33,960
- and...

1502
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:37,220
- That's actually... 
That's really dangerous...

1503
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:40,500
uh, on the source's side.

1504
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,070
Do they know how to 
take care of themselves...

1505
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,290
-  Well he knows...

1506
01:46:44,460 --> 01:46:44,960
- ...or do you know anything about...

1507
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:46,290
- ...he means it's, uh...

1508
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:49,810
It's all being done.. 
through this...

1509
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,740
- OK.

1510
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,370
- and they're all talking this way...

1511
01:46:54,690 --> 01:46:55,430
- OK.

1512
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:56,660
- and, uh...

1513
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:59,340
- I was gonna say 
one of the big questions there is:

1514
01:46:59,670 --> 01:47:01,060
can they handle it? 
You know with...

1515
01:47:01,290 --> 01:47:02,870
- Yeah, they're very careful...

1516
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:04,460
even they're through that.

1517
01:47:04,690 --> 01:47:05,460
- OK

1518
01:47:05,730 --> 01:47:06,440
- Yeah.

1519
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,920
- And...

1520
01:47:18,670 --> 01:47:21,300
- That's what that is.

1521
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,100
- Wow, that's really something.

1522
01:47:28,510 --> 01:47:29,850
- Oh, oh...

1523
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:38,390
- Did you know that?

1524
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:45,860
One key thing: ALL drone strikes are done through 
Ramstein Air Base in Germany - German govt has always 

1525
01:47:46,090 --> 01:47:47,390
- It's not the actual plan.

1526
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,450
- Right, right right. You mean the control.

1527
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:51,310
- It's the process, who's sending the...

1528
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:52,530
- Yeah.

1529
01:47:52,920 --> 01:47:57,170
- There's a... There's a chart. 
You know, it goes like a whole layout in it

1530
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:58,350
for everyone and it's...

1531
01:47:58,570 --> 01:47:59,890
- Yeah. It's really bold, but it's really risky.

1532
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:01,880
But you know that... that's the thing if...

1533
01:48:02,090 --> 01:48:02,790
- There's more...

1534
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:03,930
- ... if they understand what they're doing.

1535
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:08,560
-  There's this chart, it goes like this... 
It shows the decision making chart.

1536
01:48:08,840 --> 01:48:15,180
It's a chart... It's, it's... it's shaped like this.

1537
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:18,770
- Hum hum...
- So up here it says "POTUS" (President of the Uniteed States)

1538
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,690
- That's the decision making chart for each... one.

1539
01:48:26,930 --> 01:48:27,330
- And...

1540
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:29,160
- And it's so political...

1541
01:48:29,390 --> 01:48:33,310
- This is...  This part's amazing.

1542
01:48:37,410 --> 01:48:38,460
- That's...

1543
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,690
- That's fucking ridiculous.

1544
01:48:41,610 --> 01:48:43,270
- This... This is... it's so shocking.

1545
01:48:46,050 --> 01:48:48,430
- (laugh) That's...

1546
01:48:50,090 --> 01:48:50,490
- No, I know...

1547
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,100
- That's...

1548
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:51,730
- ... I know...

1549
01:48:52,550 --> 01:48:54,880
There are 1.2 m people on various stages 
of their watch list.

1550
01:48:55,340 --> 01:48:57,140
- ... the population of an entire country.

1551
01:48:57,570 --> 01:48:58,410
- I know.

1552
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:01,980
- That's... what we're working on.

1553
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:14,650
- That person is incredibly bold, but, uh...

1554
01:49:15,530 --> 01:49:16,980
- But also very well aware.

1555
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:19,050
- Right. I... You know, I just hope. I mean...

1556
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:20,800
- No, I mean...

1557
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:23,210
the boldness of it is shocking, 
but I mean it was obviously..

1558
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,350
- But the other thing is just...

1559
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:26,760
- ...motivated by what you did, 
I mean, it...

1560
01:49:27,450 --> 01:49:29,140
- This is going to... This is going to...

1561
01:49:29,790 --> 01:49:31,620
That could raise a profile

1562
01:49:32,530 --> 01:49:33,790
of this whole political situation

1563
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,390
with whistleblowing 
to a whole new level, because...

1564
01:49:36,700 --> 01:49:37,310
- exactly...

1565
01:49:37,660 --> 01:49:38,750
- It's gonna...

1566
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,800
- Yeah, I mean...

1567
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:41,390
I actually think 
that's a great thing.

1568
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,680
And I think people 
are gonna see what's being hidden...

1569
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:48,230
again, again.. 
by a totally different part 

1570
01:49:50,940 --> 01:49:54,160
POTUS
